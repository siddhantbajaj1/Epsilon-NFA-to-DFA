# Epsilon-NFA-to-DFA
The following repo contains a C code for converting Epsilon NFA to DFA.
The Input format seems to be the only drawback of this code. The above two examples demonstrate the input format.
The images provided are pretty self explanatory.
On the plus side the code is very efficient and has worked perfectly for all the test cases that I tried.
I have provided ample number of comments to help understand the code (though it might still feel pretty complicated).
Any Issues would be greatly Welcome !!
